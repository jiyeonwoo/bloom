# Flower Blooming and Climate Analysis in California
A python-based data visualization analysis on flower blooming and climate in California. 

## Background and Business Task
California has a wide variety of blooming plants across its many ecosystems. With climate patterns shifting over time, it can be hypothesized that flower blooming times and patterns can also shift. This analysis observes flower blooming data in California over a 10 year period starting from 2015 to determine if there has been a significant shift in blooming patterns since then. 

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Data
The phenology data was downloaded from the [USA National Phenology Network](https://www.usanpn.org/), while the climate data was retrieved using the [Daymet API](https://daymet.ornl.gov/).
